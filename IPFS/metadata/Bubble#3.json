    "description": "Bubble is a Project based on the speculation as a human parasitism and its criticism per se. This artwork developed by OPN Studio (Susana Ballesteros & Jano Montañés) http://opnstudio.com tackles two important issues within this society. 

    First, “speculation within the Art world” showing how speculation makes the object something insignificant. And how it eliminates its true value by converting it only into speculative objects being stripped of their natural beauty, criticism and meaning, being able to reach large sums of money due to the action of greed and speculation, displacing to one side, its true cultural value. 
    
    Second “Carbon Footprint / Pre-Merge Carbon Footprint” human being greed shows no limits, and this is reflected as a parasite interaction within biodiversity and this artwork. “Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone's need, but not everyone's greed.”
    
    Bubble consists of 10 unique NFTs. These NFTs are recreations of scenes where persistent symbiosis occurs between different organisms of imaginary species, giving rise to examples of symbiotic mutualism, increasing their biological fitness (survival capacity). Mutualism describes the ecological interaction between two or more species where each species has a net benefit. Mutualism is a common type of ecological interaction. These symbiosis scenes represent the opposite of human being interaction within biodiversity.
    
    To conclude,
    20% of the benefits will go for reforestation to help owned and inherited carbon footprint offset.",
